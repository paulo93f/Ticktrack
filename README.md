## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Scribe. To view the documentation, ensure the application is running and visit:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```
In case you want to generate new documentation with your changes, run:
```
php artisan scribe:generate  
```

## Authentication

This application uses Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication. To use the API endpoints, include your token in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_token
```

## Postman collection

I made a postman collection for this API, so you don't have to ðŸ˜œ.

```
storage/postman/TicketTrack.postman_collection.json
```
If you don't know how to import, read the [official documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/) for the current version.
